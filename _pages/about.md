Hi, I’m Yueyang Feng (冯跃洋), a PhD student in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore, where I am advised by Prof. Ilya Sergey. I received my Bachelor’s degree from the ACM Honors Class, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), where I had the privilege of working closely with Prof. Qinxiang Cao. I also spent six months as a research intern at Yale University, supervised by Prof. Zhong Shao.

My research interests lie in Program Verification, Programming Languages, and Software Engineering. I recognize that program verification is currently costly and difficult to adopt in industry, and through my research I aim to make it more accessible, scalable, and practical for real-world applications.

You can find my publications <a href="publications"> here. </a>

<a href="/oi-blog"> here </a> is my old blog, where I used to write problem solutions and some essays during high school when I was participating in programming contests. The blog is written in Chinese and is no longer maintained. I am considering setting up a new one.
